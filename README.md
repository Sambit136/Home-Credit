# Home Credit

### Summary of business problem and project objective

Home Credit is presently encountering the risk of loan defaults due to extending loans to
individuals in underserved demographics, who possess either inadequate or non-existent credit
histories.

The proposed project aims to iden@fy customers with low or no risk, enabling the provision of
loans to this group. The project will employ the following analy@cal problem-solving approach
The goal is to iden@fy customers with both low and high risks of loan repayment through
the implementa@on of a predic@ve classifica@on model.

The binary target variable is the "target" column, indica@ng whether a customer is
experiencing payment difficul@es with their loan or not. Predictor includes columns like
AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT, FLAG_OWN_CAR, FLAG_OWN_REALTY

The success of this project lies on the effective identification of both low and high-risk
customers. By achieving this, Home Credit can expand its loan offerings for low-risk customers,
thereby increasing revenue generation and enhancing overall profitability.

The project output will include a roster of customers who are likely to repay the loan amount,
ensuring that individuals with no credit history are not rejected.
